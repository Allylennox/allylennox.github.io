<p> I came from a small town in South Jersey. I was born and raised there and all of my best memories are from that little town. The smallness of the community is what I believe made me the person I am today. It gave me close friendships that (I hope) will last a life time and also made my family grow closer. As a person I describe myself as fun, free flowing, wild, and caring. Living in the woods of south jersey made me cherish the small moments. My friends and my family are the most important things in my life. Without them I would be lost. The following two videos are homemade videos my friend made from our home football games last year. Friday night lights at our school was bigger than the football team. Every friday the whole school and community came together to cheer, laugh, and have the time of our lives. These videos show some of the happiest moments during my time in Shamong.</p>

<p>As a child of the 21st century, social media is a big part of my life. I pride myself on that fact that I dont live on it but I do love being connected with all of my friends and family and being able to see what they are all up to.</p>

<p>Growing up in Jersey I have grown fond of the city of Philadelphia. It always has something to offer. Cheesesteaks, great coffee, endless adventures, and amazing sights. Even though I am a New York Giants fan I can safely say that my favorite city is Philly. The show It's Always Sunny in Philadelpia incorporates all of mu favorite things: laughing and the city of brotherly love. Below is a link to some of the funniest moments of the show and hopefully a little insight on what makes me happy. </p>
