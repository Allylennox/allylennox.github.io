<h1>Alexandria Lennox's Homepage</h1>




<div class="paragraph"> <p>Welcome to <b><i>my</i> website</b>! I am a current student at the University of Maine. My intended major is Marketing and a possible minor in biology. In the future I plan to find a job in the pharmaceutical representative area. In my free time I like to workout, play golf, read, surf, hike, and listen to music. A lot of my free time is spent with my friends and family. I am from New Jersey so I dont have the luxury of being with my family and friends all the time now. I'm from a very small town back in Jersey so I am used to being at most 15 minutes away from all my friends. Back at my high school I was very involved. I played golf, soccer, lacrosse (for one year), track, and I was part of clubs like DECA, Interact, SADD, Student Goverment, and I volunteered my time towards my community whenever I could. In my opinion that is what I owe my amazing childhood to. Always being involved allowed me to meet so many new people and gave me a group of amazing friends. I decided that I needed something new though. That is why I chose the University of Maine. It is extremly far from home but I needed to go find my own adventure. I was fortunate enough to be raised in an envierment where being yourself was encouraged. It is hard to get used to but I have a good feeling Maine will be my next great adventure.</p></div>
